
Usage:
Just build the program using make in the trunk directory, then cd to this 
directory and run:
> ./dlr_data_set map.circles

It then reads the odometry and landmark measurements and obtains the least 
square solution for the corresponding SLAM problem.
It outputs all intermediate results in separate files which can be plotted 
using e.g. gnuplot.

Optionally you can provide estimations for the landmarks as a second file.
It then holds the provided landmarks fixed and optimizes only the poses 
(and landmarks which were not provided).

Format of logfile is described within map.circles.

The optional landmark file has to have only landmarks one per line like:
X Y id
separated by spaces or tabulators. Order is not important.
