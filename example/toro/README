The programs here are logfile compatible with the toro framework [1].
They can either run on the raw data or on data preprocessed, i.e. after
the node reduction but before the optimization or after the optimization.
Node reduction is not done within this example program.

Example logfiles for both 2D and 3D cases can be obtained via svn at:
https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/toro/data
(You should download the whole project though, for comparision and to run
SLoM with preprocessed data.)

Usage:
Compile using make in the trunk directory

Change back to this directory and run
$ ./relation2d $(TORO2D_LOGFILE)
or
$ ./relation3d $(TORO3D_LOGFILE)

It outputs the coordinate and orientation (as quaternion) of each vertex
after each iteration.

Results:
For the 2D-logfile, SLoM converges quite fast on the raw data and it gets a 
smaller residuum than toro2d.

UPDATE (2009-11-30):
After a bugfix in the quaternion encapsulation the 3D case now converges at 
least locally. After a single step of toro-optimization it needs about five 
Gauss-Newton steps.
Global convergence is still problematic as the start-values are far away from 
the optimal solution and the problem is highly non-linear.
