The programs here are logfile compatible with the toro framework [1].
They can either run on the raw data or on data preprocessed, i.e. after
the node reduction but before the optimization or after the optimization.
Node reduction is not done within this example program.

Example logfiles for both 2D and 3D cases can be obtained via svn at:
https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/toro/data
(You should download the whole project though, for comparision and to run
SLoM with preprocessed data.)

Usage:
Compile using make in the trunk directory

Change back to this directory and run
$ ./relation2d $(TORO2D_LOGFILE)
or
$ ./relation3d $(TORO3D_LOGFILE)

It outputs the coordinate and orientation (as quaternion) of each vertex
after each iteration.

Results:
For the 2D-logfile, SLoM converges quite fast on the raw data and it gets a 
smaller residuum than toro2d.
For the 3D-logfiles SLoM doesn't converge to the optimal result (this is
quite problematic for SLoM as here the start-values are far away from the
optimal solution and the problem is highly non-linear.

Further remarks and comparisions might come in near future ...
